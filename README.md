## Probably approximately correct high-dimensional causal effect estimation given a valid adjustment set

To create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, run
```
bash setup.sh
```

The synthetic experimental results can be replicated by running
```
run experiments/synthetic/synth_experiment.py
run experiments/synthetic/compute_and_plot.py
```
in `ipython`. The output is in `figures/density=0.5/normalized_seed=3.png`
